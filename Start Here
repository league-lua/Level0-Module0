These recipes use a mix of the LOVE game engine and the standard Lua interpreter.
Use the appropriate interpreter for each under Project > Lua Inpterpreter

For LOVE recipes set the project file to the folder you're working on such as a_shapes_and_colors, the engine will run from main.lua

For recipes using the Lua Interpereter the project folder can be anywhere as long as the Lua file is the active one.

To get started with a_shapes_and_colors, right click the folder, go to Project Directory and select Set To Selected Directory.
Don't forget to change the interpreter to LOVE
