--]]

function love.load()
  
  -- 3. Create variable to hold love.mouse and love.graphics
  
  
  -- 4. Create variables to hold the images for the face and mustache
  
  
  --5. Set the window size, make it big enough for the face you chose
  
  
end

function love.draw()
  -- 6. Create variables for the screen width and height
  
  
  -- 7. Create variable for the x scale and the y scale
  -- For sx divide the screen width by the face's pixel width
  -- For sy divide the screen height by the face's pixel height
  
  
  -- 8. Draw the face
  
  
  
    -- 9. Draw the mustache with g.draw()
    
  

  -- 10. Change the mustache code to use m.getX() and m.getY()
end

  Add or subtract from the mouse position so the center of the mustache appears where the mouse pointer is
  
  Add an if statement so the mustache is only drawn when the mouse is clicked
